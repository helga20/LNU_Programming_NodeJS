Implement next tasks as small separate programs in separate files.
Functions can be used, but they are not required for this tasks.

1. Calculate solutions for a quadratic equation (квадратне рівняння).
Predict 3 cases - 2, 1, 0 solutions.

const a = 2, b = 3, c = -5; // expected x1 = -2.5, x2 = 1


2. Check two strings if they are anagrams of one another.
Use object to count string letters. Use cycle for-in to compare count of letters.

// access to object props can be done via [] operator
const letters = {};
letters["a"] = 1;

// if same letter is present again increase counter
let letter = "b";
letters[letter] += 1;


3. Sort array via quick sort algorithm.
const arr = [25, 4, 18, 14, 2, 9];


4. Create an object to represent a student (name, email, isActive, group, list of courses).
Initialize array of 5 students.
Find user by name.
Find all students that are attending certain course.
