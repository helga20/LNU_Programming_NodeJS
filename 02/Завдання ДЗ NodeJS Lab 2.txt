Read file with text (200-400 words).
Write all words with odd number of letters in file out-odd.txt
Write all words with even number of letters in file out-even.txt

Implement different cases as separate small programs:
1) use sync file read API
2) use async file read API with callbacks (only callbacks)
3) use async file read API with promises (use API that returns promises, all callbacks should be wrapped in promises if needed)
4) use async file read API with async/await functions (use API that returns promises, only async/await should be used to interact with promises)
